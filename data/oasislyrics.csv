0,Shakermaker,"I'd like to be somebody else
And not know where I've been
I'd like to build myself
A house out of Plasticine

Ah, shake along with me
Ah, shake along with me

I've been driving in my car
With my friend Mister Soft
Mister Clean and Mister Benn
Are living in my loft

Ah, shake along with me
Ah, shake along with me

I'm sorry but I just don't know
I know you said I told you so
When you're happy and you're feeling fine
Then you'll know that it's the right time
Then you'll know that it's the right time

To shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me

Mister Sifter sold me songs
When I was just sixteen
Now he stops at traffic lights
But only when they're green

Ah, shake along with me
Ah, shake along with me
Ah, shake along with me

Ah, shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with them
Shake along with me
Shake along with them
Shake along with me"
1,Rock 'n' Roll Star,"I live my life in the city
And there's no easy way out
The day's moving just too fast for me
I need some time in the sunshine
I've gotta slow it right down
The day's moving just too fast for me

I live my life for the stars that shine
People say, ""It's just a waste of time""
Then they said, ""I should feed my head""
That to me was just a day in bed
I'll take my car and drive real far
They're not concerned about the way we are
In my mind my dreams are real
Now you concerned about the way I feel
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star

I live my life in the city
And there's no easy way out
The day's moving just too fast for me
I need some time in the sunshine
I've gotta slow it right down
The day's moving just too fast for me

I live my life for the stars that shine
People say, ""It's just a waste of time""
Then they said, ""I should feed my head""
Oh, that to me was just a day in bed
I'll take my car and drive real far
You're not concerned about the way we are
In my mind my dreams are real
Now you concerned about the way I feel
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star

You're not down with who I am
Look at you now, you're all in my hands tonight

Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star

It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll"
2,Live Forever,"Maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone?

Maybe I just wanna fly
Wanna live, I don't wanna die
Maybe I just wanna breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

I said maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone?

Maybe I will never be
All the things that I wanna be
Now is not the time to cry
Now's the time to find out why
I think you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

Maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone

Maybe I just wanna fly
Wanna live, I don't wanna die
Maybe I just wanna breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

Gonna live forever
Gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever"
3,Up In The Sky,"Hey, you! Up in the sky
Learning to fly, tell me how high
Do you think you'd go
Before you start falling?
Hey you! Up in the tree
You wanna be me, well, that couldn't be
'Cause the people here
They don't hear you calling

How does it feel
When you're inside me?

Hey you! Wearing the crown
Making no sound, I've heard you feel down
Well, that's just too bad
Welcome to my world
Hey you! Stealing the light
I heard that the shine's gone out of your life
Well, that's just too bad
Welcome to my world

How does it feel
When you're inside me?

You'll need assistance with the things that you
Have never ever seen
It's just a case of never breathing out
Before you've breathed it in
How does it feel
When you're inside?
I can feel you
Can you feel me?

Hey you! Up in the sky
Learning to fly, tell me how high
Do you think you'll go
Before you start falling?
Hey you! Up in a tree
You wanna be me, well, that couldn't be
Cause the people here
They don't hear you calling

How does it feel
When you're inside me?

You'll need assistance with the things that you
Have never ever seen
It's just a case of never breathing out
Before you've breathed it in
How does it feel
When you're inside?"
4,Columbia,"I've seen so much to disgust mother, take me into your arms... how am I to protect you?

There we were, now here we are
All this confusion, nothing's the same to me
There we were, now here we are
All this confusion, nothing's the same to me

I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me
I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me

What I heard is not what I hear
I can see the signs, but they're not very clear
What I heard is not what I hear
I can see the signs, but they're not very clear

So I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me
I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me

This is confusion, am I confusing you?
This is confusion, am I amusing you?
This is peculiar, we don't want to fool ya'
This is peculiar, we don't want to fool ya'

Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
5,Supersonic,"I need to be myself
I can't be no-one else
I'm feeling supersonic, give me gin and tonic
You can have it all, but how much do you want it?
You make me laugh
Give me your autograph
Can I ride with you in your BMW?
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine

You need to find out
'Cause no-one's gonna tell you what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you want to say
But before tomorrow

'Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody can ever hear him call
Nobody can ever hear him call

You need to be yourself
You can't be no-one else
I know a girl called Elsa, she's into Alka-Seltzer
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train
And she makes me laugh
I got her autograph
She done it with a doctor on a helicopter
She's sniffing in a tissue selling the Big Issue

When she finds out
No-one's gonna tell her what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you want to say
But before tomorrow

'Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody can ever hear him call
Nobody can ever hear him call

6,Bring It On Down,"What was that sound ringing around your brain?
Today was just a blur you've got a head like a ghost train
What was that sound ringing around your brain?
You're here on your own who you gonna find to blame?

You're the outcast
You're the underclass
But you don't care, because you're living fast
You're the uninvited guest who stays 'til the end
I know you've got a problem that the devil sends
You think they're talking 'bout you, but you don't know who
I'll be scraping their lives from the sole of my shoe tonight

Bring it on down, bring it down for me
Your head's in a fish tank
Your body and your mind can't breathe

Bring it on down, bring it out of me
Your head's in a fish tank
Your body and your mind can't breathe

You're the outcast
You're the underclass
But you don't care, because you're living fast
You're the uninvited guest who stays 'til the end
I know you've got a problem that the devil sends
You think they're talking 'bout you, but you don't know who
I'll be scraping their lives from the sole of my shoe tonight"
7,Cigarettes & Alcohol,"Is it my imagination
Or have I finally found something worth living for?
I was looking for some action
But all I found was cigarettes and alcohol

You could wait for a lifetime
To spend your days in the sunshine
You might as well do the white line
'Cause when it comes on top
You gotta make it happen
You gotta make it happen
You gotta make it happen
You gotta make it happen

Is it worth the aggravation
To find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for?
It's a crazy situation
But all I need are cigarettes and alcohol

You could wait for a lifetime
To spend your days in the sunshine
You might as well do the white line
'Cause when it comes on top
You gotta make it happen!
You gotta make it happen!
You gotta make it happen!
You gotta make it happen!

You gotta, you gotta, you gotta make it
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta fake it
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta make it
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta fake it
"
8,Digsy's Dinner,"What a life it would be
If you could come to mine for tea
I'll pick you up at half past three
We'll have lasagna
I'll treat you like a queen
I'll give you strawberries and cream
Then your friends will all go green
For my lasagna

These could be the best days of our lives
But I don't think we've been living very wise
Oh no, no

What a life it would be
If you could come to mine for tea
I'll pick you up at half past three
We'll have lasagna

These could be the best days of our lives
But I don't think we've been living very wise
Oh no, no

What a life it would be
If you could come to mine for tea
I'll pick you up at half past three
We'll have lasagna

I'll treat you like a queen
I'll give you strawberries and cream
Then your friends will all go green
Then your friends will all go green
Then your friends will all go green
For my lasagna

9,Slide Away,"Slide away and give it all you've got
My today fell in from the top
I dream of you and all the things you say
I wonder where you are now

Hold me down all the world's asleep
Need you now you've knocked me off my feet
I dream of you and we talk of growing old
But you said ""Please don't!""

Slide in baby, together we'll fly
I've tried praying
But I don't know what you're saying to me

Now that you're mine
We'll find a way
Of chasing the sun
Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning we don't know what to do
Two of a kind
We'll find a way
To do what we've done
Let me be the one who shines with you
And we can slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Away

Slide away and give it all you've got
My today fell in from the top
I dream of you and all the things you say
I wonder where you are now

Slide in baby, together we'll fly
I've tried praying
And I know just what you're saying to me

Now that you're mine
We'll find a way
Of chasing the sun
Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning we don't know what to do
We're two of a kind
We'll find a way
To do what we've done
Oh, let me be the one who shines with you
And we can slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away (and I wanna try now, I wanna make you mine now)
Slide away (and I wanna try now, I wanna make you mine now)
Slide away (and I wanna try now, I wanna make you mine now)
Slide away (and I wanna try now, I wanna make you mine now)

(Don't know, don't care
All I know is you can take me there)
(Don't know, don't care
All I know is you can take me there) Slide away
(Don't know, don't care
All I know is you can take me there) Slide away
(Don't know, don't care
All I know is you can take me there) Slide away
(Don't know, don't care
All I know is you can take me there) Slide away
(Take me there, take me there, take me there) Slide away
(Take me there, take me there, all I know is you can take me there) Slide away
(Take me there, take me there, take me there) Slide away
(Take me there) slide away (take me there) slide away (take me there) Slide away"
10,Married With Children,"There's no need for you to say you're sorry
Goodbye. I'm going home
I don't care no more so don't you worry
Goodbye. I'm going home

I hate the way that even though you
Know you're wrong you say you're right
I hate the books you read and all your friends
Your music's shite it keeps me up all night
Up all night

There's no need for you to say you're sorry
Goodbye. I'm going home
I don't care no more so don't you worry
Goodbye. I'm going home

I hate the way that you are so sarcastic
And you're not very bright
You think that everything you've done's fantastic
Your music's shite it keeps me up all night
Up all night

And it will be nice to be alone
For a week or two
But I know then I will be right
Right back here with you, with you
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you

There's no need for you to say you're sorry
Goodbye. I'm going home
I don't care no more so don't you worry
Goodbye. I'm going home
"
11,Sad Song,"Sing a sad song
In a lonely place
Try to put a word in for me
It's been so long
Since I found this space
You better put in two or three
We as people, are just walking 'round
Our heads are firmly fixed in the ground
What we don't see
Well it can't be real
What we don't touch we cannot feel

Where we're living in this town
The sun is coming up and it's going down
But it's all just the same at the end of the day
And we cheat and we lie
Nobody says it's wrong so we don't ask why
'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
We're throwing it all away
We're throwing it all away
We're throwing it all away at the end of the day

If you need it
Something I can give
I know I'd help you if I can
If you're honest and you say that you did
You know that I would give you my hand
Or a sad song
In a lonely place
I'll try to put a word in for you
Need a shoulder?
Well if that's the case
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do

Where we're living in this town
The sun is coming up and it's going down
But it's all just the same at the end of the day
When we cheat and we lie
Nobody says it's wrong so we don't ask why
'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
You're throwing it all away at the end of the day
