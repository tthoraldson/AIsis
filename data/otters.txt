Oasis lyrics for a song about otters


Verse 1:
Cute and cuddly, furry and small,
Otters have been swimming around since time began
From rivers and streams to the ocean they roam,
These playful creatures will never be alone

Chorus:
Otters, otters, swimming around,
Frolicking in the waters so sound
Oh, the joy of watching them play
They'll bring us joy all day

Verse 2:
Diving in deep and swimming around,
Otters are always making a happy sound
Playing in groups, they never will tire,
Smiling and laughing, they never retire

Chorus:
Otters, otters, swimming around,
Frolicking in the waters so sound
Oh, the joy of watching them play
They'll bring us joy all day

Bridge:
Cute and cuddly, furry and small,
Otters have been swimming around since time began
Splashing and laughing, they always play,
These little critters will light up your day

Chorus:
Otters, otters, swimming around,
Frolicking in the waters so sound
Oh, the joy of watching them play
