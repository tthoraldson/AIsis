Prompt: Oasis lyrics for a song about avocado prices

Repsonse:
Verse 1:
Might as well have a guac attack
Cause the avocado prices have gone through the roof
Can't afford them no matter what I do
Gonna have to find another way through

Chorus:
It's the avo-crisis, it's no surprise
The costs of avos must be sacrificed
It's hard to bear when prices go so high
It's the avo-crisis, it's no surprise

Verse 2:
Can't get a quesadilla, no burrito
Cause I just can't afford the guac on top
Think I'm just gonna have to survive
Without avos in my life

Chorus:
It's the avo-crisis, it's no surprise
The costs of avos must be sacrificed
It's hard to bear when prices go so high
It's the avo-crisis, it's no surprise

Bridge:
Can't get it for cheap, can't get it for free
Don't know what I'm gonna do
Can't get it for cheap, can't get it for free
Gonna have to go without my guac
